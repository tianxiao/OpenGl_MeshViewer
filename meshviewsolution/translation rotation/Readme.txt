Talk about the Matrix transformation

You must first decided the verctor is column or row
like 
   v(x,y,z) 
       or
  v'( x,
      y,
      z,)


And the matrix is like this
A
a00, a01, a02,
a10, a11, a12,
a20, a21, a22,


Then the local coordinate will be 
rv = v*A
or
rv = A*v'

Becare about this


And the Matrix4X4 will have different format

R00,R01,R02,
R10,R11,R12,
R20,R21,R22,
